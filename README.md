# patterns

This is the source code of _Patterns_, an app that tracks patterns in your day-to-day life and
tells you how your habits correlate with each other.

## Technologies involved

Patterns is a cross-platform app built with Flutter.

It relies on the following third-party Flutter libraries:

* `firebase_auth` for authentication;
* `cloud_firestore`, `flutter_riverpod` and `shared_preferences` for state management;
* other dependencies (see `./pubspec.yaml`)
